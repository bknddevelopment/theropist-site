# GitHub Pages Deployment Fix - COMPLETED ✅

## Problem Identified
The GitHub Pages site was showing the README.md instead of the actual Next.js application.

## Root Causes
1. **Missing `.nojekyll` file**: GitHub Pages uses Jekyll by default, which ignores directories starting with underscore (like `_next`). This was preventing CSS and JavaScript files from being served.
2. **README.md at root**: Jekyll was processing and serving the README as the main page instead of the built `index.html`.

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Added `.nojekyll` File (3 locations)
- ✅ Created `/public/.nojekyll` - ensures it's copied during build
- ✅ Created `/.nojekyll` - repository root backup
- ✅ Modified build script to create `out/.nojekyll` automatically

### 2. Updated GitHub Actions Workflow
- ✅ Added step to create `.nojekyll` in the `out` directory after build
- This ensures the file exists even if the build process changes

### 3. Modified Build Script
- ✅ Updated `package.json` build command: `"build": "next build && touch out/.nojekyll"`
- Now automatically creates `.nojekyll` after every build

### 4. Added Jekyll Configuration
- ✅ Created `_config.yml` to explicitly include `_next` directory
- Provides additional configuration for GitHub Pages

## Files Modified/Created
1. `/public/.nojekyll` - NEW (empty file)
2. `/.nojekyll` - NEW (empty file)  
3. `/_config.yml` - NEW (Jekyll config)
4. `/package.json` - MODIFIED (build script)
5. `/.github/workflows/deploy.yml` - MODIFIED (added .nojekyll step)

## Next Steps to Deploy

### Option 1: Push to GitHub (Recommended)
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix GitHub Pages deployment - add .nojekyll to prevent Jekyll processing"
git push origin main
```

The GitHub Actions workflow will automatically:
1. Build the Next.js app
2. Create `.nojekyll` file
3. Deploy to GitHub Pages
4. Your site will be live at: https://bknddevelopment.github.io/theropist-site/

### Option 2: Manual Verification
Test locally that everything builds correctly:
```bash
npm run build
ls -la out/.nojekyll  # Should show the file exists
```

## Verification Checklist
After deployment, verify:
- [ ] Site loads at https://bknddevelopment.github.io/theropist-site/
- [ ] CSS styles are applied (not plain HTML)
- [ ] JavaScript is working (interactive elements)
- [ ] Images load correctly
- [ ] Navigation works with the `/theropist-site` base path

## Why This Fix Works
1. **`.nojekyll`** tells GitHub Pages to serve the site as-is without Jekyll processing
2. **Build script modification** ensures the file is always present in deployments
3. **GitHub Actions update** provides redundancy to ensure deployment success
4. **`_config.yml`** provides explicit Jekyll configuration as a fallback

## Important Notes
- The `basePath` and `assetPrefix` in `next.config.ts` are correctly configured for `/theropist-site`
- The built files in `/out` directory correctly reference the base path
- All static assets will be served from `https://bknddevelopment.github.io/theropist-site/_next/`

## Success Indicators
When the fix is working:
- You'll see the styled Sonoma Wellness Retreat homepage
- NOT the README content
- All images, styles, and scripts will load correctly
- The site will look exactly as it does in development
